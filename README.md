# 100DaysofML

Day 1 -> Applied a Simple Linear Regression model on the dataset and found the r2_score to be 0.81 and made a webapp using Flask , deployed it in Heroku.  
Day 2 -> Applied a Lasso,Ridge,ElasticNet models on the dataset and found the r2_score is almost similar to that of Simple Linear Regression.  
Day 3 -> Participated in the Hacklive guided community Hackathon by Analytics Vidhya - https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/hacklive-guided-community-hackathon   
Day 4 -> Performed basic Feature enginerring techniques on cross-sell-prediction dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction  
Day 5 -> Feature scaling is very important as each and every feature might be of different unit like height in cms/mts/feet etc. If features are not scaled properly, the overall model will be useless. Data doesn't always come clean. Most of the times it has missing values and they must be handled without which the features might loose their predictive power. As part of Day 5 I have used MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, RobustScaler for scaling the features and also performed different imputation techniques on the missing numerical features (like mean/median/Mode replacement, Arbitrary imputation, random sample imputation, new column imputation of nan etc.) All these are performed on the titanic and house price prediction datasets from kaggle. datasets - https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques , https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
